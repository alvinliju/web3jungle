# Web3 Jungle

Welcome to Web3 Jungle! This project is a work in progress and is part of my learning journey in web development, particularly with Next.js and Web3 technologies. Please note that there might be a lot of issues and the code may not adhere to industry standards as I am learning and building this project on the fly.

## Project Overview

Web3 Jungle is an experimental project where I aim to explore and implement various Web3 concepts and technologies. The goal is to build a platform that showcases decentralized applications (dApps) and other Web3 projects.

## Current Status

This project is still in its early stages, and many features are yet to be implemented. The codebase is constantly evolving as I learn and apply new concepts.


## Disclaimer

Please be aware that this project is a learning exercise. The code may contain bugs, and the implementation may not follow best practices. Any feedback or suggestions for improvement are welcome as I continue to learn and grow as a developer.
